## Garbage In = Garbage Out

1. May be easy (movie ratings -> new movie ratings)
2. May be harder (gene expression data -> disease)
3. Depends on what is a "good prediction"
4. Often [more data > better models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvDCzhbjYWs)
5. The most important step!

## Features Matter!

**Properties of good features**

- Lead to data compression
- Retain relevant information
- Are created based on expert application knowledge

**Common mistakes**

- Trying to automate feature selection
- Not paying attention to data-specific quirks
- Throwing away information unnecessarily

## Prediction Is About Accuracy Tradeoffs

- Interpretability versus accuracy
- Speed versus accuracy
- Simplicity versus accuracy
- Scalability versus accuracy

## Interpretability Matters
