# ROC Curves



## Why a Curve?

- In binary classification you are predicting one of two categories
    - Alive/dead
    - Click on ad/don't click on ad
- But your predictions are often quantitative
    - Probability of being alive
    - Prediction on a scale from 1 to 10
- The _cutoff_ you choose gives different results
