## Example: Predicting Wages

Data from: [ISLR package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ISLR/) from the book: [Introduction to statistical learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)

## Example: Wage data

```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
data(Wage)
Wage <- subset(Wage, select=-c(logwage))
summary(Wage)
```

---

## Get Training / Test Sets

```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=Wage$wage, p=0.7, list=F)
training <- Wage[inTrain,]
testing <- Wage[-inTrain,]
dim(training)
dim(testing)
```

---

## Feature Plot

```{r}
featurePlot(x=training[,c("age","education","jobclass")],
            y=training$wage,
            plot="pairs")
```

---

## Plot Age Versus Wage

```{r}
qplot(age, wage, data=training)
```

---

## Plot Age Versus Wage, Color by Job Class

```{r}
qplot(age, wage, color=jobclass, data=training)
```

---

## Plot Age Versus Wage, Color by Education

```{r}
qplot(age, wage, color=education, data=training)
```

---

## Fit a Linear Model

$$
ED_i = b_0 + b_1 age + b_2 I(Jobclass_i = "Information") + \sum_{k=1}^4 \gamma_k I(education_i = level_k)
$$

$I(Jobclass_i = "Information")$ - binary dummy variable: 1 when `jobclass` = "Information", 0 when not equal to "Information" ("Industry", in this data)

$\sum_{k=1}^4 \gamma_k I(education_i = level_k)$ - set of 4 dummy variables (each with coefficients $\gamma_k$) for the 5 levels in the `education` factor

```{r}
modFit <- train(wage ~ age + jobclass + education, method="lm", data=training)
finMod <- modFit$finalModel
print(modFit)
```

---

## Diagnostics

```{r}
plot(finMod, 1, pch=19, cex=0.5, col="#00000010")
```

---

## Color by variables not used in the model

Useful when you want to explain residual variance by possible other covariates

```{r}
qplot(finMod$fitted, finMod$residuals, color=race, data=training)
```

---

## Plot by Index

Whenever you can see a trend by index, it suggests that there's a variable missing from your model, or your data. Often it suggests a relationship w/ time or age or some other continuous variable.

```{r}
plot(finMod$residuals, pch=19)
```

---

## Predicted Versus Truth in Test Set

```{r}
pred <- predict(modFit, testing)
qplot(wage, pred, color=year, data=testing)
```

---

## If You Want to Use All Covariates

```{r}
modFitAll<- train(wage ~ .,data=training,method="lm")
pred <- predict(modFitAll, testing)
qplot(wage, pred, data=testing)
```
